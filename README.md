An immersive Bible exploration app

## Purpose

There is a lot wrong with social media. However, one thing that social media
apps do well is to allow you to skim read a broad range of content and drill
down into specifics that interest you. This is a new type of reading that is not
possible with physical books. It lets you assemble, on the fly, a new collection
of writing around a theme that's interesting to you at the moment. The cost to
this deep, curiosity-driven focus is that we are less exposed to ideas that we
are uninterested in. At worst, this leads to myopic thinking and a false view of
the world. However, as long as it is not one's only source of information, the
self-directed deep dives of social media applications make for a fascinating new
way to consume content.

What if it was possible to explore the Bible this way? First, you scroll past a
wide range of excerpts from scripture. After ignoring 2, 20, or 100 verses, you
find one that reminds you of something going on in your life or something you've
been thinking about recently. It's confusing, so you zoom out and read a few
verses before it and a few after. You'd like to know more, so you swipe to a few
thematically related verses (cross references). One word is confusing, so you
deep click into the greek word for a quick dictionary entry (it's fascinating,
so you scroll through the list of verses where that words is used in the New
Testament). That was interesting, but you've read enough. You jump back to the
home screen and continue scrolling.

That's Scroll. 

## FAQ

### What content will the app expose?

The text of the Holy Bible (ideally with many translations), cross references,
interlinear Bible, Greek/Hebrew concordance.

### Will there be a social/sharing aspect to the app?

No. Although it is inspired by a social media news feed, the content we're
scrolling through in the app is from the Bible, not from our friends. 

### Are you planning on commercializing this?

No, I don't have time or room in my current employment contract for that. Three
end states that I can see are (1) abandon the project, or (2) the prototype is
useful for a few friends, or (3) the prototype is interesting enough that we can
pitch it to an organization like Blue Letter Bible and have them take over
operating and developing the app.

## Timelines

This is a low-importance hobby project for me that I may ignore for months or
years (or I could abandon it). It's still very experimental.
