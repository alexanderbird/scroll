# Scroll Bible Developer Guide

## Git Clone

This project is a monorepo that uses git submodules to separate the different
components. To check out all the code, run

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/alexanderbird/scroll

If you don't have read access to all the submodules, ask one of the other
contributors.

For more notes on working with submodules, consult the git docs or try a web
search. This README is intentionally not a comprehensive guide on working with
submodules because that content is already written elsewhere. If you find a
particularly good resource on the topic, feel free to include the link here.
