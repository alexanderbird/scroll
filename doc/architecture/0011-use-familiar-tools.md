# 11. use familiar tools

Date: 2022-12-08

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I'm working on this solo in my free time; it's a prototype.

## Decision

Use the tools and technologies that I'm familiar with.

## Consequences

The project will be more fun and quicker. I may choose inappropriate tools.

The biggest obstacle to the project is access to properly licensed Bible texts.
It's way out of scope to fund and negotiate licensing deals with a bunch of
Bible publishers; the goal would be to have an organization that already has
digital publication rights for many Bible translations to pick up the project.

That organization will probably have specific technology preferences (which I
couldn't guess) so it probably doesn't matter what specific technologies I
choose for the prototype anyway.

I'll get it working, I'll make the prototype compelling, and then we'll
reevaluate technology decisions.
