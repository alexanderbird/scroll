# David's notes

## Main things

### one
Number one thing I like is that it's fast -- when I'm just clicking through and
it just does it, that's great. This feels fast and quick, and that's why I would
use it. If it was any slower I wouldn't use it. 

### two
Most needed: type in the reference to look up. Make this very quick. Often you
have a verse in mind and want to get in really quick. E.g. Bible Gateway you can
type in the reference (with abbreviations). I could type in a three letter
abbreviation and use a period instead of the colon and boom it's up there. 

David uses the Logos Bible software and it's a keyboard shortcut. Cmd+G to open
reference tool, and type abbreviated reference. 

### three -- "reading mode"
What I don't like is how separated the verses feel. You can't just read through.

On the Chapter page I'd like it to be less separated -- make it look like the
text (paragraph, etc.) and highlight a verse like you do with the words. 

Just for the chapter page / context page.

#### maybe not worth doing
When I'm reading on logos I can click on a word and on the bottom of my screen
it tells me what the greek is and all the details about it. I use it often when
I'm reading English and I just want to check what the word is.

Almost instinctively I read on my Bible app (ESV) I tap the word and nothing
comes up. Oh shoot, I would have to go over to my computer. What I really want
is for the word to be just like the ESV app cross references. When you press, a
comic book quotation bubble pops up.

I would read my Bible on this app, I click on this word and the box that pops up
is the thing that is on another page. 

## minor notes

- [x] when I'm into the Strong's number by clicking on a word I can go back to the
  original verse. I'd also like to click through each word in the verse as if
  that verse is selected.
- [x] need a back button
- [x] on mobile, when a verse is tapped but the link isn't navigated, it's
  highlighted with the hover color and it's confusing/weird. Don't do that on
  touch devices.
- [x] emoji icons are weird
- on Word page, you say "which means something like" -- is that correct? Should
  it not say "in this cotext it means" or something like that? Are you using the
  Strong's dictionary correctly?
    - the Strong's doesn't cover the multifaceted aspect of the word
    - consider using Outline of Biblical Usage (see BLB)

## Big picture

Alex: would you use this?

David -- I would not use this because I have Logos. Maybe for my Bible reading,
if it was a better reading experience as the ESV app. (Dark mode, cross
references, etc.; and also has the Greek stuff.)

However, most people don't have access to the resources that I have for this. 

### Alex:

Goal: more Christians study God's word more deeply  
Hypothesis: if there is a tool that makes Strong's numbers easier to access,
more will use it


David: I think there's a good chance that your hypothesis is correct, but I'm
not sure I agree with your goal. If folks don't know how to use these tools,
they can draw weird conclusions.

These tools can lead folks to distrust their Bible translators.

There is a reason the word was translated a certain way in this translation.

David: the "definition" we're showing here, we would call "gloss" -- a quick
picture.

Alex: maybe put a callout that the gloss excludes a lot of nuance.


Objective -- more about helping folks find new things in their Bible, not about
deconstructing their Bible.


David: "helping people see the hyperlinks in the Bible is helpful -- to see the
scope of their Bible"

### other comments

There's a podcast called Bible Talk where they go through the Bible a few
chapters at a time and discuss the text. Their thing is "how do you see these
arcs and related phrases". If you listen to a few of their podcasts it might
give you ideas to help people see it.
